## 1.0 - 14 Jul 2023

This release moves the repository to [clj-commons](https://github.com/clj-commons/humanize); we thank
[Thura Hlaing](https://github.com/trhura)'s efforts in initiating this project. As part of this move, the Maven
artifact coordinates have changed, as well as the namespaces.

### Added
- Tools build building and deployment
- Github actions CI
### Changed
- Switches from [`com.andrewmcveigh/cljs-time`](https://github.com/andrewmcveigh/cljs-time) to [`com.widdindustries/cljc.java-time`](https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time). This is a potentially breaking change.
- Update dependencies to the most recent versions
- Switched build to deps.edn
### Fixed
- Code cleanup (warnings generated by clj-kondo)
- Eliminate "already refers to" compiler warnings with Clojure 1.11.x

## 0.2.2 - 15 Oct 2016

`clj-commons.inflect/datetime` now supports diffs that represent a 
time in the future, as well as _centuries_ and _millennia_ diffs.

Fix pluralizing nouns that end in _ff_.


## 0.2.1

`clj-commons.inflect/pluralize-noun` now pluralizes a count of zero; previously any count less
than or equal to 1 was considered singular.

Added `clj-commons.humanize/duration` and `duration-terms` to format a duration, in
milliseconds, as a string.
