## 0.2.2 - 15 Oct 2016

`clojure.contrib.inflect/datetime` now supports diffs that represent a 
time in the future, as well as _centuries_ and _millennia_ diffs.

Fix pluralizing nouns that end in _ff_.


## 0.2.1

`clojure.contrib.inflect/pluralize-noun` now pluralizes a count of zero; previously any count less

milliseconds, as a string.
